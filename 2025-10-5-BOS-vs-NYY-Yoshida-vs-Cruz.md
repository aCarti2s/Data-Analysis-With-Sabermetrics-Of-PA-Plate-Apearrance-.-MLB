I  quoted a post from the account Talking Baseball about the BOS @ NYY game on X, where we can see Masataka Yoshida of the Red Sox facing Yankees right-hander Fernando Cruz in the top of the 7th inning, with Nate Eaton on second, Jarren Durán on first, and two outs. Yoshida came in for Rob Refsnyder and this was his first plate appearance of the night at Yankee Stadium.

Cruz’s first pitch to the lefty Yoshida was a splitter at 81.6 MPH. Yoshida took it for ball one. That splitter came with 844 RPM spin, -3 IVB (which is actually a solid value), 44 inches of vertical drop, and 8 inches of horizontal break to the right. It’s a deceptive pitch, but Yoshida — who’s running just below league average chase% this season (27.3% vs. 28.4%) — didn’t go after it.

The second pitch was a slider at 81.1 MPH, also taken for a ball. The slider, being a breaking pitch (vs. the splitter as offspeed), had a much higher spin at 2797 RPM, with -2 IVB and 47 inches of drop. Count goes to 2–0.

Before getting to the fun part, this is where it’s worth pausing to talk about why spin rate, IVB (Induced Vertical Break), vertical drop, and horizontal break matter. It’s simple and complicated at the same time: every pitch is an opportunity for the pitcher to miss bats or induce bad swings/decisions, but also an opportunity for the hitter to square one up. If a pitcher throws something that’s “easy to hit,” that’s when doubles and home runs happen.

Take IVB and drop: they tell us how much a pitch actually falls with gravity, and how much it appears to resist that fall. A crude example: say a pitcher throws a 100 MPH four-seamer with 2999 RPM and +21 IVB, with only 9 inches of drop. Gravity pulled it down 9 inches, but the high spin made it appear to rise by 21 inches. That’s why understanding spin, IVB, drop, etc. is so important. If a pitcher can’t execute mechanically and loses that effect, that pitch is way more likely to get crushed.

Back to Yoshida: on pitch three, Cruz went to the four-seam fastball at 94.0 MPH, with 2330 RPM, +17 IVB and 16 inches of drop. Yoshida again took it. Count 3–0.

Looking at Cruz’s stats, in 17 prior 3–0 counts this season, he’s thrown the four-seamer 16 times and a sinker once. Results: 4 walks, 12 called strikes, 1 swing. So the heater was totally predictable here.

Sure enough, the fourth pitch was another fastball, 94.7 MPH, 2337 RPM, +19 IVB, 12 inches of drop, for a called strike. He put a lot behind it, maybe frustrated Yoshida wasn’t chasing. Interestingly, you can see how Cruz’s mechanics change here: against Vladdy Jr. (same pitch, same zone, same velo and spin), he barely lifts his back foot. Against Yoshida, he almost hops off the mound. Adrenaline? Fired up to finally get a strike? Who knows…

Fifth pitch: another four-seamer, but this time in zone 12, at 93.8 MPH, 2249 RPM, +17 IVB, and 15 inches of drop. That’s a tough pitch to hit, and more surprising is that Cruz had never thrown to zone 12 all season. Even in nearby zone 11, his spin never spiked that high — his max average there was 2108 RPM, and in 4 of 5 tries he issued walks.

Then came the real action: pitch six, another four-seamer, 94.8 MPH, 2300 RPM, +17 IVB, 14 inches of drop. Yoshida put it in play for a single, 97.0 EV, 2° launch angle, 60 feet of distance, with a .460 xBA.

There’s a ton of credit due for putting that pitch in play. It was the hardest pitch Cruz threw that PA, with 17 IVB making it look like it was rising, while still dropping 14 inches.

Now the fun details: • Perceived velocity: even though the pitch was 94.8 MPH, it was perceived at 96.1 MPH. That 1.3 MPH bump was purely spin-driven. • Release point: Vertical release 5.98 ft, horizontal release -2.45 ft. For a righty, releasing that far glove-side is unusual — almost like a lefty release point. Yoshida essentially had to read it from an odd angle. • Extension: 7.1 ft, which shortens the flight time and makes velo “play up.” That’s why it looked 96+ despite 94.8. • Plate location: Plate horizontal 0.01 (basically dead-center) and plate vertical 3.31 (right at the top edge of the strike zone, which runs ~3.4–3.6). So this was center-cut but up — one of the hardest zones for a hitter.

So, Yoshida connected on a pitch at nearly 95 that “played” 96, from a weird release angle, with heavy ride (+17 IVB), 14 inches of true drop, and at the very top of the zone. Not an easy ball to hit.

The LA of 2° tells us it was almost a whiff/strikeout ball, because those tend to produce grounders. The EV of 97.0 is solid — elite guys like O’Neil Cruz push 105+, but 97 off the bat is legit, especially for a grounder. The xBA of .460 reflects that too — a ground ball but hit hard.

Bat speed was 69.3 mph (not blazing), with an attack angle of 6°, meaning the bat was slightly upward at contact. Attack direction of 14° oppo (OPP) is interesting. Being a lefty, that swing direction suggests he was late, pushing the ball the other way instead of pulling it. If he’d been earlier, he could have pulled it with better loft.

All in all, Cruz threw quality stuff — big spin, big extension, tough angle — but Yoshida still managed to square up just enough. That PA ended with the bases loaded, 2 outs, and Boston’s win probability jumping by 4.6 percentage points. That’s baseball: Cruz executed, but Yoshida battled and found a way.
